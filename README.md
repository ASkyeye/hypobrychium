Duplicate not owned Token from Running Process without detections

Duplicates the token of a running process and executes a command.

To be used when there is a process on behalf of a Domain Administrator, or to spawn a CMD on any process.

When used with third-party PIDs, there will be no screen input/output in the CMD, but the shell works fine.

Source will be published soon, I'm making it watchable ;-)
It was written in Delphi (Lazarous)

Special thanks to Ewan who developed some high professional Units.

have fun
